# Mattie Weathersby Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. This space shares my journey as I grow into software engineering and UX/UI design. I have a passion for creating clean, visually appealing user interfaces and bringing together design, technical thinking, and business strategy to build meaningful digital experiences.

## About Me
I’m a creative problem solver who enjoys turning ideas into visuals that feel good to use. My background in brand strategy and digital design taught me how to understand people, what they need, and how to communicate through design. Now, I’m applying those same skills to building better user experiences and learning the technical side of how products come to life.

## Experience
**Brand Strategist | Self-Employed (May 2021 – Present)**  
- Helped clients shape their brand voice, story, and overall look  
- Applied color and layout principles to create consistent digital visuals  
- Conducted simple user and audience research to better understand who we were designing for  
- Created marketing content that helped clients connect with their audience more effectively  

## Purpose of This Repo
This repository will hold the code for my personal portfolio website. It will feature my projects and show how I blend design, technology, and business thinking to create thoughtful user experiences.
